#-  Mercurial configuration file

#-  .hgignore ~~
#
#   This file contains user-defined filename patterns that Mercurial should
#   ignore when it computes changes. Typically, we want to ignore any hidden
#   or temporary files created by the operating system or text editor, but I
#   should stress that we do not, under _any_ circumstances, want to add a
#   rule that may cause us to exclude an important file accidentally. Thus,
#   my own policy is to script and monitor every step of my workflow except
#   for version control -- always execute your commits manually!
#
#   For more information, see hgignore(5).
