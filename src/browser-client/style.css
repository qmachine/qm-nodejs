/*- style.css ~~
 *
 *  This file declares some of the presentation-layer settings for the browser
 *  client's graphical user interface (GUI) -- the webpage, "index.html". This
 *  file will be concatenated and/or minified along with Twitter Bootstrap as
 *  part of "style-min.css", which means that some or all of these settings may
 *  be overridden by Twitter Bootstrap's defaults. Consequently, I have removed
 *  some of my original rules simply to reduce the file size.
 *
 *  NOTE: I truly hate "slashstar" comments because I have never found a way to
 *  write them that doesn't make me want to claw my eyes out. If you have any
 *  ideas, let me know :-)
