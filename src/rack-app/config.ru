#-  Rack configuration file

#-  config.ru ~~
#
#   This is a self-contained Rack app that uses Sinatra's domain-specific
#   language (DSL) in tandem with SQLite to implement a teaching version of
#   QMachine. The idea here is to pack most of the functionality of the
#   original Node.js codebase into a single file that reads like pseudo-code.
#
#   Of course, there are some caveats. This version succeeds in abbreviating
#   the original codebase, but it doesn't support all of the original options
#   yet. The code can also be hard to modify if you're unfamiliar with Sinatra,
#   because Ruby's scoping rules are very different from JavaScript's, and
#   Sinatra's DSL makes things even "worse", to be honest. My advice here is,
#   don't think too hard about it. Just enjoy it.
#
#   I do plan to merge this program with the Ruby gem in the future, which is
#   why the database schema matches the Node.js implementation's (which is not
#   as straight-forward as it could be). For now, it serves its purpose, and it
#   does so with just 98 lines of source code ;-)
#
#   NOTE: Using a "%" character incorrectly in a URL will cause you great
#   anguish, and there isn't a good way for me to handle this problem "softly"
#   because it is the expected behavior (http://git.io/bmKr2w). Thus, you will
#   tend to see "Bad Request" on your screen if you insist on using "%" as part
#   of a 'box', 'key', or 'status' value.
