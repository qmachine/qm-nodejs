#   Currently, this Rack app is being developed with Ruby 2.0.0-p0 (MRI), and
#   it doesn't work in JRuby because of the dependence on the 'sqlite3' gem.
#   There are certainly ways to rectify this "problem", but I don't want to
#   clutter up the code because it's only meant to be a teaching tool anyway.
#   JRuby support is certainly on my wishlist, though :-)
#
#   For future reference, however, in case I change my mind:

#       -   https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord
#
#   NOTE: I wasn't able to deploy this app as-is to Heroku until I disabled the
#   API server *and* commented out the "sqlite3" dependency.
